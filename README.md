# The-Ionospheres-Binary-Secret-A-Tale-of-LDA-and-QDA-Classifiers
This GitHub repository contains the implementation of a binary classification problem using the Ionosphere dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset consists of a 351x34 real-valued matrix of predictors and a categorical response Y, which represents "good" and "bad" radar returns. The objective is to evaluate the classification performance of an LDA and a QDA classifier using 5-fold cross-validation. The repository provides the implementation code along with the confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve, and area under the curve results for each classifier.
